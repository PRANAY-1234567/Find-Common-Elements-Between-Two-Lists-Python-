📌 Description

This program finds common elements present in two Python lists.
It compares each element of the first list with the second list and stores matching values.

🧠 Problem Statement

Given two lists, find elements that appear in both lists.

Example
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]

Output:
[3, 4]

✅ Code Explanation

list1 and list2 contain integer values

An empty list common is used to store matching elements

The for loop checks each element in list1

if x in list2 checks whether the element exists in the second list

If found, the element is added to the common list

Finally, the list of common elements is printed
